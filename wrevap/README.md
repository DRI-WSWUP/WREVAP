# WREVAP - GCM

The original WREVAP code was modified to support being run using Global Climite Model (GCM) input data.

Differences between versions:
+ An input parameter file must be passed to the script (using the **--ini** command line argument)
+ A separate CSV output file (*.OUT) is created
+ Precipitation (PPT) values are carried through the model
