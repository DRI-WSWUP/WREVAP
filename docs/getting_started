Original Documentation
----------------------
It is highly recommended that the user read the original WREVAP model documentation.
Most questions about the WREVAP model, parameters, or units, can be answered by
referring to the original WREVAP documentation `(Morton et al., 1985)
<https://github.com/DRI-WSWUP/WREVAP/blob/Python3/docs/Morton_1985.pdf>`_.
This version of the WREVAP model is functionally similar to the original WREVAP,
however input format and options has been significantly improved for easy data
entry and formatting. Additional model improvements are noted below and described
in detail in this documentation. All changes to the input data, parameters, and format are
outlined below. Where possible, the section number of the original documentation
is listed in square brackets [].



Model Improvements
------------------
This version of the WREVAP model is functionally similar to the original WREVAP,
however several model improvements have been added.

The CRLE routines have been updated to support the use of variable reservoir depths.
The original CRLE routines in WREVAP supported only the use of mean average depth,
and an option has been added to allow the use of depth timeseries. WREVAP has also
been updated to read in precipitation timeseries along with the required
meteorological variables. Precipitation is not used in the calculation of evaporation,
however it provides easy comparison between evaporation and precipitation, and allows
for easy calculation of net evaporation. WREVAP has been modified to write out
reservoir elevation and precipitation timeseries and to calculate mean monthly and
annual values.
